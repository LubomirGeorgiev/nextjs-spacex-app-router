# SpaceX API UI using Next.js

This is a UI wrapper for https://docs.spacexdata.com/.

All of the data is fetched from https://docs.spacexdata.com/, then cached and finally Server-Side-Rendered. No client-side fetching is happening in the user's browser.

Tech stack
1. Server and rendering - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
2. UI and Styles - [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
3. API endpoints and data fetching - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)

## Installing
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
